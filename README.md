# Key Signature Finder

## Overview

The Key Signature Finder is a Python application built with Tkinter that helps musicians identify matching key signatures based on the notes they enter.

## Features

- Allows users to enter up to four musical notes to find corresponding key signatures.
- Validates input against a predefined list of key signatures.
- Displays matching key signatures or notifies the user if no matches are found.
- Provides an option to reset the input fields.

## Notes

- Ensure all notes are entered using capital letters without spaces or numbers.
- Use '#' for sharps and 'b' for flats (e.g., C#, Db).
- Maintain consistent formatting. For instance, use either flats (e.g., Db) or sharps (e.g., C#) within your entries, but not both in the same input.
- The program assumes familiarity with basic music theory concepts related to key signatures.
